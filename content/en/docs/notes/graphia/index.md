## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

1. **Download** the latest release `.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/marzzelo/graph-plugins/releases).
2. **Extract** the contents into Graph's `Plugins` folder:
   - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Graph\Plugins` (All users, requires Admin)
   - or `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Graph\Plugins` (Current user only)
3. **Run the installer** to set up the Python environment:
   - Double-click `install.bat` (Command Prompt)
   - Or right-click `install.ps1` and select "Run with PowerShell"
4. **Restart Graph**. The plugins will be automatically loaded.

> **Note**: The installer creates a `.packages` folder with all required Python packages. This requires an internet connection.

### Manual Installation

Choose one of the following plugin locations:

1.  **All Users** (Requires Administrator privileges):
    *   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Graph\Plugins`
2.  **Current User Only**:
    *   `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Graph\Plugins`

Then create the packages folder manually (see Development Setup below).

# 1. Analysis

## FFT - Fast Fourier Transform

Computes the amplitude spectrum of the selected point series using the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. Uses `scipy.fft.rfft` optimized for real-valued signals.

**Parameters:**
*   **Window Function**: Apply a window function before FFT (Hann, Hamming, Blackman, etc.) to reduce spectral leakage.
*   **Zero Padding**: Extend signal to the next power of 2 for improved frequency resolution.
*   **Output Type**: Choose between amplitude spectrum, power spectrum, or power spectral density.
*   **Normalization**: Select appropriate normalization for the output.

**Output:**
The plugin generates a new point series representing the frequency domain, with frequency (Hz) on the X-axis and amplitude/power on the Y-axis.

---

## IFFT - Inverse Fast Fourier Transform

Reconstructs a time-domain signal from its frequency-domain representation using the inverse FFT. Uses `scipy.fft.irfft` for efficient computation.

**Parameters:**
*   **Input Series**: The frequency-domain spectrum (typically output from FFT).
*   **Sample Rate**: The original sampling rate for correct time scaling.
*   **Output Points**: Number of points in the reconstructed signal.

**Usage:**
This plugin is typically used after FFT processing, such as spectral filtering or modification, to convert the signal back to the time domain.

# 2. Smoothing

## Gaussian Filter

Applies a Gaussian smoothing filter to the selected point series. This is useful for reducing noise in experimental data while preserving the general trend.

**Parameters:**
*   **Sigma**: The standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel in units of the X-axis. Controls the "width" of the smoothing. Suggested value: approximately 1% of the X range.
*   **Mode**: Determines how the signal is extended at the boundaries (e.g., `nearest`, `reflect`, `mirror`).
*   **Truncate**: Limits the size of the kernel to a number of standard deviations (default is 4.0).
*   **Result**: Choose to create a **New Series** (preserving the original) or **Replace** the existing one.

---

## Selective Median Filter

Applies a median filter to remove "salt and pepper" noise or outliers without blurring sharp edges as much as a linear filter.

**Parameters:**
*   **Window Size**: The number of points in the sliding window (must be an odd integer, e.g., 3, 5, 7).
*   **Threshold**: The deviation threshold. If the difference between a point and the median of its neighbors exceeds this value, the point is replaced by the median.
*   **Result**: Create a new series or replace the original.
